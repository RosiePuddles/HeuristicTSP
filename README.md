# A Heuristic Solution to the Metric TSP problem
This repo is for code relating to a possible heuristic solution to a special case of the widely known [travelling salesperson problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) known as the metric TSP, where all points satisfy the triangle rule, s.t. we can represent all points on a two-dimensional Euclidean plane.

## What's in the repo?

This repo includes the [solution algorithm (main.py)](main.py), the written report as both a [pdf](TSP_report.pdf) and [TeX](TSP_report.tex) file, and a directory with a set of tests in for [7](tests/7.csv), [8](tests/8.csv), [9](tests/9.csv), and [10](tests/10.csv) points. There is also a csv file for the [results of testing]() the current algorithm against the testing sets.
> There may be an issue here, with the use of testing sets during writing the algorithm. They have not been used as training sets
